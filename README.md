## Project Introduction<a name="intro"></a>

By creating customer segmentation and comparing to general population, one can know which part of the general population are more likely to be customer and which part are not. I analyzed demographics data for customers of a mail-order sales company in Germany, comparing it to demographics information for the general population.    
Firstly, I used different approaches to pre-process the data, and then I used unsupervised learning techniques, PCA (Principle Componets Analysis) and k-NN (k-nearest neighbor algorithm), to perform customer segmentation and to identify the core customer traits of the company.    
Secondly, with demographics information for targets of a marketing campaign for the company, I used different models to predict which individuals are most likely to convert into customers.    
Finally, I also tested the model in competition through kaggle, where the competition is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/udacity-arvato-identify-customers/).


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

Since the dataset is private, only the meta-data is uploaded here.

- Arvato_Project_Workbook.ipynb: The main analysis file
- DIAS_Attributes_Values_2017.xlsx: the meta-data (a detailed mapping of data values for each feature in alphabetical order)
- DIAS_Information_Levels_Attributes_2017.xlsx: the meta-data (a top-level list of attributes and descriptions, organized by informational category)
- predic_result_lr.csv - the rediction results (used logistic regression)
- predic_result_lr_PCA20.csv - the rediction results (used logistic regression and 20 PCA componets only)
- predic_result_rf.csv - the rediction results (used random forest)



## Results<a name="results"></a>

- Segementation part:    
Using PCA and KMeans, I got the results as follows.
    - The population who tend to be customer: The people who may be adults and usually shop online.
    - The population who might not be customer: The people who are not rich, nor focusing on the brand of cars. However, they tend to use cars often. Some of them might have some anti-society characteristics.    

- Supervised Learning Prediction part:    

The results were not good. For the three models (logistic regression, random forest and k-NN), none of them has good precision even used GridSearch.
